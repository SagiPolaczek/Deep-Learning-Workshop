# Deep-Learning-Workshop

Welcome to our workshop github repository!

To run the demo, clone the repository, install the requirements (located in requirements.txt file), and run `python ./demo.py`.

Note that the demo doesn't support `python 3.10` because one of the requirements does not.
Please consider using: `conda create -n dlw_workshop python=3.8`


For a more complicated runs you should have a machine with a GPU and arrange the corresponding data files.
