# Deep-Learning-Workshop

### Welcome to our workshop github repository!


To run the demo, clone the repository, install the requirements (located in requirements.txt file), and run `python ./demo.py`.
The demo is running on a small subset of the EPSILON dataset. To run on the entire dataset follow the `epsilon_runner.py` file, for the case of `run_local=False`.

Note that our source code doesn't support `python 3.10` because one of the requirements does not support it.
Please consider using: `conda create -n dlw_workshop python=3.8` or any other version of python above 3.7.



For a more complicated runs you should have a machine with a GPU and arrange the corresponding data files.
